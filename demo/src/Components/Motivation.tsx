        The main goal of <Name /> is to provide a modern and fast library for
        processing PDB files, moving beyond solutions typically implemented in
        dynamic languages or legacy C/C++ code. This library delivers
        exceptional performance with a clean, type-safe API while ensuring
        cross-platform compatibilityâ€”making it ideal for both traditional
        applications and web-based tools through WebAssembly.
